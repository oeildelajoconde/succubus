        angel is slender and silent, bearing long raven-black hair and one hazel eye beside one pale blue.
        she often wears pale, sheer or neutral clothing, and exudes a ghostlike grace.
        her presence is quiet, nearly immaterial.
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="personality" class="tabcontent">
      <div class="content">
        she is observant, careful, melancholic. she thinks in soft spirals and speaks gently.
        reserved but emotionally complex. angel is a mirror to others, often losing herself within their moods.
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="biography" class="tabcontent">
      <div class="content">
        angel was born between time zones, moving often. she spent years in boarding schools, reading by candlelight and keeping to herself.
        her present is made of blurred mornings, heavy eyelids and neverending notebooks.
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="relationships" class="tabcontent">
      <div class="content">
        she has brief connections. her most important relationship is zeny, someone with whom words are scarce but meaning overflows.
        with others, she is polite but unreachable.
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="likes" class="tabcontent">
      <div class="content">
        likes: typewriters, old poetry books, cold hands, tea with too much milk.
        dislikes: loud voices, digital clocks, fluorescent lighting, being misunderstood.
